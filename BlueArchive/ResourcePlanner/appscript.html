        <p>BA Resource Planner Updater is a small script to perform an update to the Resource Planner spreadsheet, it copies new sheets / named ranges from the source spreadsheet to replace the current ones.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It also retains data between relevant fields on the old and new versions of each sheet, to prevent needing to re-enter data everytime, or copy paste into a new spreadsheet every time changes are made to the source.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The app only makes changes to a spreadsheet it is attached to, and only if it contains an identifier tag, to prevent making changes if the app is added to the wrong type of spreadsheet.</p>
